                <h3>Perfessional Team</h3>
                <p>Morphometry Design Studio are leading Interior Designing and Architectural Service provider. As experienced Interior and architectural consultants we are responsible for the outside and inside project we undertake to complete. First we design the architectural lay out of the place and then proceed to fill up the place with interiors that literally breathe life into the living or working space as the case may be. Each building has a responsibility to its environment, natural and urban, as well as its occupants. This results in a particular design solution, unique to each project. We hold a common belief that the approach to each architectural project should be a comprehensive design solution. Most of our work exhibits this commitment; encompassing the building envelope, the interior space, the finishes, furnishings, and lighting; all of which are generally custom designed by us. The composition of forms, use of varied materials, and the manipulations of color throughout identify the work that we undertake.</p>
